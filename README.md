## About me :mortar_board:
I am a student of Information Systems, currently studying at the Federal University of Ceará. I had my first contact with technology 5 years ago and since then I fell in love with this area 😍. In addition, I am a computer technician. Studying technology challenges me to always go beyond my limits and want to learn a lot more. I am passionate about data science, web development and new challenges. 🧠
